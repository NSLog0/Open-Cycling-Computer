1. [DONE] Saving setting (i.e. current layout)
2. [DONE] Split module tests from main part and use consistent naming
3. [DONE] When bmp183 is not connected Ctrl-C doesn't quit occ.py 
4. [DONE] Add visualisation of clickable areas for easy debugging
5. [DONE] Editing units (selection list)
6. [DONE] Conversion table for units, start with basic km <-> mph
7. [DONE] Editing single digits in numbers
8. [DONE] Avoid highlighting when sweeping (MOUSEMOTION should be OK for that)
9. [DONE] Find a solutin to black square under hidden cursor. pygame.mouse.set_pos() ? - Solved with 90dbdfc0eb8f1b7ce115eee0e0f942bcdadb1c97
11. [DONE] Use this for rel_movement: >>> from operator import add >>> map(add, list1, list2)
15. [DONE] Allow for changing units of non-editable params like speed or temperature. Block edit in editor but leave unit switching?
16. [DISCARDED] Reading time since boot from gps? - there is no need fo this
17. [DONE] Logging to file to debug field test crashes
18. [DONE] Setup formatting for logger as per https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html
19. [DONE] Add more logging, dump ride params to log?
20. [DONE] Cut down logging without losing information
21. [IN TESTING - see MOD[20] Rare error on start

	Update: twice same error showed up in my code
22. [DONE] Use for exceptions logging: Logger.exception(msg, *args, **kwargs)
23. [DONE] Add option for easy rendering icons, like a small image that is overlapped on top of background.
24. [DONE] Units switching for non-editable parameters
25. [DONE] Saving preferred units to config file
26. [DONE - text file] Database setup + full ride logging. Or just text file and normal logging?
	http://bytes.com/topic/python/answers/44055-logging-two-files
29. [DONE] Read time from GPS when it will be battery powered
30. [DONE] Read config_base if there is no config.xml file
32. [DONE] Resetting records
33. [DONE] Add total_time (no speed trigger)
34. [DONE] Speed gets stuck when loosing fix at speed != 0
35. [DONE - for pressure] Kalman for altitude
36. [DONE - in settings] Unit editor for non-editabl parameters like speed. Long click to trigger. Or units in Settings?
37. [DONE] Mousemove turn off highlight
39. [DONE] Resetng speed_max doesn't wrk
40. [DONE] Setting home altitude has to trigger sea level pressure recalculation
41. [DONE] Icons with different states, i.e. to show gps signal strength
43. [DONE] Error after stopping gpsd:

44. [DONE] Setting time from gps is breaking distance calculations. (time shift * speed is added to distance). Record time shift and make correction?
45. [TESTING] Replace speed_gps_noise with hardware option
46. [DONE] Remove oversampling of pressure when Kalman filter is in place
48. [TESTING] Ridetime, ridetime_total, odometer  are affected by time shift
49. [DONE] Altitude goes crazy in simulation mode and stabilises on 2052m
50. [DONE] GPS doesn't come back after gpsd restart

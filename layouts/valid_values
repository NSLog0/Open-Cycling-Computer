Valid function names for use in layout files:

altitude	- current altitude in meters, calculated from pressure
altitude_at_home	- home altitude - not implemented yet (fixed value) 
altitude_gps	- altitude as reported by gps unit
altitude_units	- altitude units
cadence	-	not implemented yet (fixed value)
date	-	current date
gradient	- gradient of the road - not implemented yet (fixed value)
gradient_units	- units of the gradient, % or deg - not implemented yet (fixed value)
heart_rate - not implemented yet (fixed value)
heart_rate_units - not implemented yet (fixed value)
latitude	- latitude as reported by gps unit
longitude	- longitude as reported by gps unit
pressure	- current atmospheric pressure measured by hardware (currently BMP1823)
pressure_at_sea_level	- sea level pressure calculated from pressure on start and given altitude. It's a value fixed at start
pressure_units	- pressure units
rtc	-	combined date + time 
speed	-	speed, to be calculated using Kalman filter from gps + wheel sensor - not implemented yet (fixed value)
speed_tenths - first decimal place of speed
speed_units - km/h, mph or m/s - not implemented yet (fixed value)
time	-	current time
utc	-	utc time as reported by gps unit


To add a new value it needs to be added to get_val function in ride_parameters.py with corresponding handler.

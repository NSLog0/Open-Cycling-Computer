Each layout has to contain at least 3 pages: page_0 (main page), editor and settings. Use default.xml as a template.
FIXME - list needs updating
Valid function names for use in layout files:

altitude		- current altitude in meters, calculated from pressure
altitude_home		- home altitude
altitude_gps		- altitude as reported by gps unit
cadence			- not implemented yet (simulation)
date			- current date
distance
slope			- gradient of the road
heart_rate
latitude		- latitude as reported by gps unit
longitude		- longitude as reported by gps unit
odometer		- total distance, editable
pressure		- current atmospheric pressure measured by hardware (currently BMP183 sensor)
pressure_at_sea_level	- sea level pressure calculated from pressure and given altitude. It's a value fixed at start or updated after user edit
riderweight		- weight of rider
rtc			- combined date + time 
satellites
satellites_used
satellites_visible
speed			- speed, to be calculated using Kalman filter from gps + wheel sensor - not implemented yet (fixed value)
speed_gps		- speed, reported by gps
speed_tenths 		- first decimal place of speed
time			- current time
utc			- utc time as reported by gps unit

Units:
Each parameter from above list has to have an unit defined. The name has to be the same as parameter name + _unit
i.e for speed is is speed_unit.

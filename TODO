1. [DONE] Saving setting (i.e. current layout)
2. [DONE] Split module tests from main part and use consistent naming
3. [DONE] When bmp183 is not connected Ctrl-C doesn't quit occ.py 
4. [DONE] Add visualisation of clickable areas for easy debugging
5. [DONE] Editing units (selection list)
6. [DONE] Conversion table for units, start with basic km <-> mph
7. [DONE] Editing single digits in numbers
8. [DONE] Avoid highlighting when sweeping (MOUSEMOTION should be OK for that)
9. [DONE] Find a solutin to black square under hidden cursor. pygame.mouse.set_pos() ? - Solved with 90dbdfc0eb8f1b7ce115eee0e0f942bcdadb1c97
10. Consider scroll-over-the-edge to switch pages
11. [DONE] Use this for rel_movement: >>> from operator import add >>> map(add, list1, list2)
12. Control rounding errors when switching units in editor
13. Fix inconsistent naming: func, function, param_name
14. Formating might need to be unit dependent. Showing distance in [m] with decimal point doesnt make sense
15. Allow for changing units of non-editable params like speed or temperature. Block edit in editor but leave unit switching?
16. [DISCARDED] Reading time since boot from gps? - there is no need fo this
17. [DONE] Logging to file to debug field test crashes
18. [DONE] Setup formatting for logger as per https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html
19. [DONE] Add more logging, dump ride params to log?
20. [DONE] Cut down logging without losing information
21. [IN TESTING - see MOD[20] Rare error on start

22. [DONE] Use for exceptions logging: Logger.exception(msg, *args, **kwargs)
23. [DONE] Add option for easy rendering icons, like a small image that is overlapped on top of background.
24. Units switching for non-editable parameters
25. Saving preferred units to config file
26. Database setup + full ride logging. Or just text file and normal logging? http://bytes.com/topic/python/answers/44055-logging-two-files
27. Review & avoid try/catch. It's too expensive
28. Speed filtering or max speed will be false sooner or later. Average from 2/3 samples?
29. [DONE] Read time from GPS when it will be battery powered
30. [DONE] Read config_base if there is no config.xml file
31. New editor layout. Current is confusing.
32. [DONE] Resetting records
33. [DONE] Add total_time (no speed trigger)
34. [DONE] Speed gets stuck when loosing fix at speed != 0
35. Kalman for altitude
36. Unit editor for non-editabl parameters like speed. Long click to trigger. Or units in Settings?
37: [DONE] Mousemove turn off highlight
38. Threads write to log aftred log end
39. [DONE] Resetng speedmax doesn't wrk
40. [DONE] Setting home altitude has to trigger sea level pressure recalculation

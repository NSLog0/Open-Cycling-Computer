THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS!

Model of RPI model A+is based on measurements of A+ board and drawings of B+ board from
http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/mechanical/README.md

Model of PiTFT is based on drawings by Adafruit:

Code can be run with
```
cd code
sudo python src/occ.py
```
but it is highly experimental!

10. Consider scroll-over-the-edge to switch pages
12. Control rounding errors when switching units in editor
13. Fix inconsistent naming: func, function, param_name
14. Formating might need to be unit dependent. Showing distance in [m] with decimal point doesnt make sense
27. Review & avoid try/catch. It's too expensive
28. Speed filtering or max speed will be false sooner or later. Average from 2/3 samples?
31. New editor layout. Current is confusing.
38. Threads write to log aftred log end
42. Use sprites to make smooth page switching?
47. Click to switch value i.e. click on temperature to cycle over min/average/max
51. Add backlight control
52. Add easy option to finish simulation on non RPI hardware
53. Is it possible to read date/time from GPS chip with no fix or a separate clock is needed?
54. Crash on rider weight unit change when there is a leading zero - remove leading zero immediately when not needed?
